### Dataset that we use

[Best cities and countries for startups](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/best-cities-and-countries-for-startups-in-2021)

<br>The dataset has about 1000 unique values and 9 columns. It shows best startups from different cities and countries. Each startup is matched with four scores showing its capacity in different aspects. Doing research on this dataset will provide us with knowledge about how to manage a success startup.
